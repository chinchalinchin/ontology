# State

## Static

- **Location**: _data/state/static.yaml_

Elements defined in the static state _do not_ change over the course of the game. 

## Dynamic

- **Location**: _data/state/dynamic.yaml_

Elements defined in the dynamic state _do_ change over the course of the game. As a result, the dynamic state needs persisted to the file system anytime the user saves.
